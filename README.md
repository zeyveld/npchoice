# npchoice
An open-source Python package for nonparametric discrete choice estimation

At present, supports latent-class conditional logit with (conditional) logit link. I will later add support for fixed-grid estimation, both with (conditional) logit and (multinomial) probit link functions.

My code for the LBFGS algorithm is based on the open-source Python package <i>xlogit</i>, due to [Arteaga, C., Park, J., Beeramoole, P. B., & Paz, A.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocm.2021.100339)
